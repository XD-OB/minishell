# MiniShell
![obsh](ressources/obsh.png)

![Subject](ressources/minishell.pdf)

Recoding my own little bash. A program capable of parsing a prompt and launching executables with arguments, along with a few built-in functions (meaning we don't call the executable, we re-coded them directly).
- echo, pwd, cd, env, export, unset and exit.
Alot of bonuses are added to this shell!

## Compile
- Run `make`

## Execute
- `./minishell`
